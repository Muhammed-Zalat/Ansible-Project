-Terraform Infrastructure Setup: Designed and implemented a multi-region AWS infrastructure using Terraform. Provisioned VPCs, subnets (public/private), NAT Gateways, Internet Gateways, EC2 instances, and Elastic Load Balancers across us-east-1 and us-west-1, with Route 53 for global DNS-based traffic management. Employed security groups to enforce network access policies.

-Ansible Automation: Built Ansible playbooks for end-to-end WordPress deployment, including Apache and MariaDB setup, ensuring a scalable, repeatable configuration across multiple servers.
